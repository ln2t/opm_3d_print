These files were created by Pierre Corvilain as part of the research projects "OPM-MEG for Diagnostic Evaluation of Epilepsy in School-aged Children" and "Pushing the boundaries of OPM-MEG towards early human life" during his postdoctoral position at the Laboratoire de Neuroanatomie et Neuroimagerie translationnelles (LN2T), Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, under the supervision of Xavier De Tiège. They were used in the following publications:

## Contents

This repository includes:

- *holder.stl* – OPM holder 3D printing file, works with QuSpin Inc's OPM 2nd and 3rd genration. They can be sewn on EEG caps, and the corners can be digitized using a Polhemus system.
- _cap_gen*.stl_ – small cap to place on top of OPMs, with reflective markers spaces for 3D localisation using a structured light scanner, and space for the cables to run below.
- *spacing.stl* – Small 4 mm spacing that can sewn on the cap, to prevent heat from hurting sensitive skins.
- *mapping* folder contains holders designed for mapping the MSR magnetic field, and jigs to measure the offsets of the OPMs.
- *blender files* folder contains the Blender files used to create the 3D models.

## Usage

These files are provided to help others adapt and build upon our design for their own research. The files are suitable for 3D printing with ABS, and were designed using Blender.

If you modify or improve these files, we’d appreciate hearing about your work.
